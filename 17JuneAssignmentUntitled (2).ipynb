    "The try and exception block is a fundamental construct in many programming languages.Its role is to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Try Block: Code that may potentially raise an exception is placed within a \"try\" block. This is the portion of code where error are anticipated.\n",
    "2.Exception block: Following the \"try\" block there is an \"exception\"or \"catch\" block. If an exception occurs within the \"try\" block the code inside the \"catch\" block is executed.This block contains instruction for how to handle the exception such as logging an error message or taking corrective action.\n",
    "3.Finally Block:Some languages allow you to include a \"finally\" block after the \"catch\"block. The code in the \"finally\" block is executed regardless of where an exception occurred or not. It is often used for cleanup tasks,like closing files or files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try-catch mechanism helps ensure that even if an erroe occurs the program can gracefully recover or terminate without crashing. It promotes robist error handling and allows developers to maintain better control over their code's behavior in exceptional situations."
