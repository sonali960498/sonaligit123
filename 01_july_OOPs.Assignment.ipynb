    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize complex software systems into modular, reusable components called objects. OOP aims to provide a way to structure code that reflects the real-world entities being modeled, making it easier to manage and maintain large codebases. Key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which facilitate code organization, reusability, and flexibility. Overall, the goal of OOP is to improve code quality, scalability, and maintainability by promoting modularity, abstraction, and code reuse."
