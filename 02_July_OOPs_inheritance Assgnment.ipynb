    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class (called a derived class or subclass) is created from an existing class (called a base class or superclass). The derived class inherits attributes and methods from the base class, allowing it to reuse code and extend functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Code Reusability: Inheritance allows you to define common attributes and methods in a base class and then reuse them in multiple derived classes. This promotes code reusability, as you don't need to duplicate code across multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Modularity and Extensibility: Inheritance facilitates modular design by allowing you to organize classes into a hierarchy based on their relationships. You can create specialized subclasses that inherit from a common base class and add additional attributes or methods specific to the subclass. This makes it easier to extend and customize functionality without modifying the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphic behavior, where objects of different classes can be treated interchangeably if they share a common base class. This allows for more flexible and generic code that can operate on objects of different types without needing to know their specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Maintainability: Inheritance promotes a hierarchical structure that makes code easier to understand and maintain. By defining common functionality in a base class, changes or updates to that functionality only need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of errors and improving maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, inheritance is a powerful concept in OOP that promotes code reuse, modularity, extensibility, polymorphism, and maintainability, making it a fundamental aspect of object-oriented design.\n"

    "Significance of \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance:\n",
